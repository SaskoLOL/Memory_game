# Memory_game
This is a game that uses a 320x240 tft screen and 16 mx switches. Its pretty much a meomory games, a 4x4 pattern cann be seen on the screen and some of those squares light up, try to enter them on the mx switches, if you cant do it the game starts again.

Attention! The Firmware was made with Ai!

# PCB

As said the pcb uses a tft 320x240 screen and 16 mx switches, also it uses a rp pico and 16 diodes.

The tft screen is above the 16 swicthes and the rp pico is on the bottom.

# CAD
I made a pretty simple case to store the pcb in, the screen is completly exposed and the switches are partially covered up (ofcourse there is room for the switches just the spaces in between are covered up)

As you see there are 4 holes to hold the 2 parts togerther, for that I will be using 4 M4 screws, alor 4s am I right?

MOUNTING: As you see I added 3 holes for 3x 4m screws to mount the pcb to the case.
