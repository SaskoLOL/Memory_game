So today I decided to strart a new project, I wasnt sure what to do so I just started with a screen and a few buttons, and then I got the Idea to do a memory game. I made the schmematick but I wasnt sure anymore
how to wire the buttons, so I had to look up a few tutorials, but it wasnt that hard. Then I needed to see how I need to wire the screens, I just looked at one of my other projects and saw it wasnt that hard. 
So I pretty much finished the schmeatick and went on to do the pcb. I had a few problems with lining up the switches, as keyboard layout wouldnt work in pcb so I had to do it by hand, and because as every button was
randomly scattared I had to redo it again and align every button as it was in the schematick. That took a while but the wiring after that was pretty fast as I lined it up.

So yesterday I finished the pcb so I just went to fusion and modeled the whole thing (after 5 project I still suck at it...). It took awhile to align the button holes with the switches on the pcb. The sad thing is
I again forgot to make the top case an extra component so I had to redo it. I then made the firmware (made with AI!). After I did this I not only realized that I did not make a hole for the usb cable, but I made the
case too small, so the pcb didnt even fit in... so I had to redesign it. I decided to leave the screan completly uncovered.
